// Note:

// 1. Ideal Atmospheric Conditions

// An inversion is highly likely if these conditions are met:
// High-Pressure System: Settled, clear, calm weather.
// Low Wind Speed: Less than 3 mph (or <11 km/h) in the evening and overnight.
// Clear Skies/Calm Nights: Allows the ground to cool rapidly.
// High Humidity/Moisture: High relative humidity (ideally >95%) or dew point close to the valley temperature, indicating potential for mist/fog.
// Timing: Early morning just after sunrise, or late evening.

// 2. Analytical Methods

// Temperature Profile Check: Use apps like Ventusky, or Clear Outside to check temperatures at different elevations. An inversion is likely if the temperature increases with altitude for the first few hundred meters.
// Forecasted Inversion Height: Look for a "ceiling" in weather models (like MWIS) where cold, moist air is trapped below warmer, drier air.
// Dew Point Analysis: If the dew point is similar to the valley temperature, fog is likely to form, which may turn into an inversion.

// 3. Key Predictors (The "Checklist")

// A high chance of an inversion (35% or greater) is often signaled by:
// Mist, fog, or dew in the morning.
// Cold, off-slope breezes at night.
// Temperature at valley level is colder than at higher elevations.
// Smoke or dust hanging in the air/moving sideways, rather than rising.

// 4. Optimal Timing and Location
// Season: Autumn and Winter are best, as nights are longer and colder.
// Location: Valleys, lakes, and low-lying areas near steep mountains (e.g., Lake District, Snowdonia) are ideal for catching them.

// Additional note (UV):

// UV Index Scale and Protection:

// 0-2 (Low): No protection required for most people.
// 3-5 (Moderate): Protection necessary. Seek shade, wear a hat, and use sunscreen.
// 6-7 (High): Protection required. Reduce time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m..
// 8-10 (Very High): Extra precautions needed. Unprotected skin can burn quickly.
// 11+ (Extreme): Avoid sun exposure. Unprotected skin can burn in
